\[16 \text{dBm} = 10\log_{10}{\left(\frac{(V_\text{pp}/(2\sqrt{2}))^2}{50}\right)} + 30\]
\[V_\text{pp} \approx 4 \text{V}\]
Using, \(\beta = V_\text{pp}/(2 V_\pi)\), we find \(\beta \approx 0.42\), which conveniently gives a ratio peaks of
\[\frac{J_1(\beta)^2}{J_0(\beta)^2 + 2J_1(\beta)^2} = 0.042\]
</p>

<p>
On the scope we actually, find a ratio of \(0.026\).
</p>

<p>
Making the reasonable assumption that we have around 2 dBm of loss, then we can repeat this calculation for 14 dBm and we expect it to be closer to what we actually measure. We find \(\beta = 0.34\), which gives a ratio \(0.028\).

We're sending 14 mW to EOM, getting 80 \(\mu \text{W}\) out.
</p>

<p>
Looking at the FP peaks, they do seem to vary in peak height over time quite a bit. However, due to how little power we're getting through the EOM, I'm not sure if that is due to power fluctuations in the laser itself.
