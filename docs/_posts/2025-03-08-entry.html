<p>
Lots of scattered light ~100 mV on PMT (remember pmt out is negative)
</p>

<p>
No repump because not talking to SynthHD -&gt; That's a problem (fixed now but not connecting to SynthHD is a problem to be aware of. To solve just restart the computer, if no windows update)
</p>

<p>
On camera see fluorescence from beam but need to position camera correctly for focus (4f imaging system)
</p>

<p>
Dispenser sitting at 6.5 A for a couple of hours. Unclear when it had "turned on enough" for good signal.
</p>

<p>
To optimize signal on PMT: turn down aom to 21 dbm (you can keep frequency at 89 dbm), increase area of MOT beam, turn up gain on PMT.
</p>

<p>
To get camera in approximately correct position: decrease size of mot beam, look for beam on live image preview.
</p>

<p>
Binning camera, ~300 ms exposure.
